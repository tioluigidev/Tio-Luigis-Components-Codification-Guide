# Tio Luigi's Components Codification Guide

The definitive guide for decoding electronic components (according to me ðŸ˜Ž).

- 51 types of components including resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors and fuses.
- Modern components for hobbyists, engineerings and other professionals.
- Old and vintage components for repairing and radio restorers.
- SMD, chassis-mount or thru-hole styles.

I recreated all the components in 3D to show clearly the coded information, how it is marked on the component and how to understand it in a simple way, in high resolution.

This book is not only a collections of conversion tables. It is also a repository with a lot of information about military controlled variations, odd values, manufacturer informations and much more!

Vintage componets - Are you a radio restorer? This book includes old and vintage components, even the rare ones. Stop searching blurred images from the web and checking contradictory informations. It is all here, clear and simple!
